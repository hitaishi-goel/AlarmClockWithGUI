# CodeClauseInternship_AlarmClockWithGUI


Welcome to the Alarm Clock repository! In this project, you will find a Python application that allows you to set alarms using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. You can use this alarm clock to set alarms at specific times, and it will play an alarm sound when the set time is reached.

## Project Overview

This Python alarm clock project utilizes various libraries and modules to create a functional alarm clock application. Here's a brief overview of what you'll find in this repository:

- **Python Code**: The core functionality of the alarm clock is implemented in the Python script. It uses Tkinter for the GUI, time for time-related operations, and Pygame for playing the alarm sound.

- **Images**: This repository includes image files used for the GUI, such as the alarm clock background and an icon image.

- **Alarm Sound**: You can customize the alarm sound by replacing the "alarm_sound.mp3" file with your preferred sound file. Make sure the new file is in MP3 format.

## Prerequisites

Before running the alarm clock application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- Python: You need Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- Required Python Libraries: You can install the required Python libraries using pip with the following commands:

  ```bash
  pip install tkinter pillow pygame
  ```

## Getting Started

To get started with the Alarm Clock project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hitaishi-goel/CodeClauseInternship_AlarmClockWithGUI.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**: Change your working directory to the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd CodeClauselnternship_AlarmClockWithGUl
   ```

3. **Run the Application**: Execute the following command to start the alarm clock application:

   ```bash
   python alarm.py
   ```

4. **Using the Alarm Clock**: The graphical user interface (GUI) will open, allowing you to set the alarm time. Enter the desired time in HH:MM:SS format and click the "Set Alarm" button. The alarm will trigger when the specified time is reached.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the alarm clock:

- **Alarm Sound**: Replace the "alarm_sound.mp3" file in the repository with your preferred alarm sound in MP3 format.

- **Background Image**: You can replace the "alarm_clock.jpg" image with your own background image if desired. Make sure it has the same dimensions (541x360) for optimal display.
